/**
 * The one-time C9 cutover. Older units (and bare `bun run hub`) left the fleet's
 * whole memory sitting inside a git checkout, where a single `git clean -fdx`
 * could delete it. If nothing has been written to the new location yet but the
 * old file is still in the tree, move it — and its `-wal`/`-shm` companions, so
 * a hub mid-checkpoint doesn't lose uncommitted writes — before anything opens
 * either path. Once a target file exists this is forever a no-op, so a legacy
 * file reappearing later (a restored backup, a stray checkout) is left alone
 * rather than clobbering a live target.
 *
 * Lives in its own module so `whiffle deploy init` can run it too. The hub only
 * ever finds the legacy file relative to ITSELF, and a deployment clone is a
 * different checkout from the one that has been writing the database — so from
 * the clone the module-relative guess points at a file that was never there,
 * the migration silently no-ops, and the hub comes up on an empty database
 * beside a full one. The deploy is the only place that knows both ends.

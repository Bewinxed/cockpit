/**
 * Resolving a fleet plugin to its files, at the hub, once for every machine.
 *
 * The rest of the fleet already works this way — skills.ts says it outright:
 * "an installer CLI is a wrapper around copying a directory, so whiffle runs
 * none of them". Plugins were the exception. Sync told every machine to run
 * `claude plugin install`, and that command goes to the network: it reads the
 * marketplace's manifest, finds `{ "source": "github", "repo": "owner/name" }`,
 * and clones. Four things follow, and all four are real:
 *
 *  - a machine whose `gh` is not logged in resolves that to ssh and is refused
 *    a repository the whole internet can read;
 *  - if the upstream repo is deleted or made private, every machine that has
 *    not installed it yet is stuck, and the fleet is permanently split;
 *  - a plugin that is not on github at all cannot be carried;
 *  - and nothing makes two machines agree. The manifest pins `"ref": "main"`,
 *    a moving target, so machines syncing a week apart install different code
 *    and both report `applied`.
 *
 * So the hub resolves the content itself and sync carries the bytes. A machine
 * writes them into a marketplace of its own and installs from that directory,
 * which is a form the CLI already supports (a plugin `source` may be a path
 * relative to its marketplace, which is how the official marketplace vendors
 * its own). The CLI still registers the plugin — whiffle does not pretend to
 * own `installed_plugins.json` — but it no longer fetches anything.

/**
 * Updating from the registry, which is how a machine that is not the author's

 *
 * The deployment clone this replaces tracked a git branch: a machine pulled
 * whatever had landed on `main` and built it locally. That is a reasonable way
 * for one person to run their own fleet and an unreasonable thing to hand to
 * users. It means every commit is a release, there is no version to name, no
 * way to say "stay on the previous one", and every machine needs git and a
 * full toolchain to produce a binary the author already built.
 *
 * A published version is a fact instead of a moving reference. It can be
 * pinned, compared across a fleet, and rolled back to. The bytes are built
 * once, by the release that made them, rather than once per machine.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do is decide when. It reports what is installed
 * and what is available; acting on the difference is the operator's, through
 * `whiffle update` or the fleet control that calls it.

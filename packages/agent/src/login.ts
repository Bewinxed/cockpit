/**

 * The alternative this replaces: open a terminal on the other machine. That is
 * the one thing this product exists to make unnecessary, and it was the standing
 * answer whenever a Mac's login keychain was locked — macOS binds that keychain
 * to the Aqua session, so a daemon that cannot reach it answers every turn with
 * "Not logged in" and there was nothing to do about it from here.
 *
 * Credentials land in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, which is the file Claude
 * Code itself reads. That is the actual fix rather than a way around the lock:
 * a machine holding a token of its own never has to ask the keychain anything.
 *
 * The reader's part is a browser and a paste. Nothing secret goes near this
 * process except the code they paste, and that is exchanged and dropped.

/**
 * Serves the dashboard on this machine, whichever machine that is.
 *
 * The built dashboard is an adapter-node server: it renders pages and knows
 * nothing about the hub. In development the Vite server proxies `/ws` and
 * `/api` to the hub, and the built one does not — so a dashboard started on a
 * laptop would render, then sit there disconnected. This puts the same proxy in
 * front of the built server, which is what lets the UI run anywhere and still
 * talk to a hub somewhere else on the tailnet.
 *
 * The dashboard's client always talks to its own origin. That stays true here:
 * the origin is this process, and this process is what knows where the hub is.

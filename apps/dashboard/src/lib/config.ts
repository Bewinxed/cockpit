 * `0` means all of them, and all of them is the right answer. The machine
 * reads its whole directory either way — it scans every transcript, sorts
 * them by age, and only THEN applies this — so a limit here never saved the
 * expensive part. It threw away the answer after paying for it, and the
 * sessions it discarded became unfindable: not listed anywhere, not
 * searchable, and not reachable by any link a reader could have produced.
 *
 * What arrives instead is metadata — an id, a folder, a modified time, a
 * first line. Measured on the machine this was written on: 898 transcripts
 * spanning 1.1GB on disk, and their catalogue is a few hundred kilobytes.
 * The transcripts themselves are still read one at a time, on demand, which
 * is the part that was ever worth being careful about.

   * Which lab is running a row, and what it is doing, in one 16px mark.
   *
   * The logo is the mark and the state is a badge on its corner, which is the
   * avatar-and-presence-dot arrangement, used here for the reason that pattern
   * exists: the two facts are read at different distances. Identity is a shape
   * you match at a glance, so it gets the whole slot; state is one of five
   * things, so a 6px disc of colour is enough to say which.
   *
   * This replaced a ring drawn around the logo. A ring costs its stroke and
   * then its air, twice over across the diameter, which left a 9px well in a
   * 16px slot — and a brand mark at 9px is a smudge, not a mark. The slot is
   * better spent on the logo, with the state laid over it.
   *
   * The dot does not sit *on* the logo, it sits in a hole cut out of it. The
   * mask punches the corner away so the row's own background shows through as
   * the dot's gap. A background-coloured halo would have been simpler and would
   * have been wrong the moment a row is hovered or current, because the colour
   * it was matching is no longer the colour behind it.
   *
   * Hue agrees with `ActivityDot`, because this is the same fact that component
   * reports: amber mid-turn, green at rest, red parked on a human.

/**
 * The Ledger Protocol, client side — kept out of the runes module so it can be
 * reasoned about, and tested, on its own.
 *
 * Everything here is structural: it moves numbers and stages around a plain
 * object and calls out through {@link StreamHost} for the two things it cannot
 * do itself (apply a frame, re-read a transcript). `client.svelte.ts` owns the
 * runes binding and the socket; this file owns the decisions. The split follows
 * `queue.ts` — this repo's bun tests cannot import a `.svelte.ts` module, so
 * logic that has to be proven lives in a plain one.
 *
 * The rules it enforces, in one place:
 *
 * - A session's events are applied EXACTLY once, in order, with no holes. A
 *   delta one past the cursor applies; one at or behind it is a duplicate and
 *   is dropped; one beyond it is a hole, and a hole is never papered over —
 *   nothing is buffered and nothing is applied, the client re-subscribes from
 *   what it actually has and the hub replays the middle.
 * - A backlog is checked, not trusted: contiguous from the cursor or it is a
 *   protocol violation, said once and re-subscribed rather than half-applied.
 * - A reset is the hub admitting the gap is unrecoverable. The client re-reads
 *   history through the path it already has and follows from `nextSeq`.
 * - A command is a transaction with a stage the UI can read, and stages only
 *   ever move forward.

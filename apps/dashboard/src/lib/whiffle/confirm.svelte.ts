/**
 * One confirmation primitive for the whole app.
 *
 * Destructive actions used to each carry their own `AlertDialog` + open-state +
 * a captured row — duplicated in every component, and skipped entirely in the
 * ones that never got around to it (a bare click that removed an MCP server from
 * every machine, no undo). This replaces all of that: `await confirm({...})`
 * anywhere, one `<ConfirmDialog/>` mounted once in the shell renders it.
 *
 *   if (await confirm({ title: 'Remove X?', destructive: true })) remove(x);
 *
 * The promise resolves `true` on confirm, `false` on cancel/dismiss. A new ask
 * while one is open cancels the first — there is a single dialog, so there is a
 * single question at a time.

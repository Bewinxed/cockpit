/**
 * Two fingers move between groups on the phone.
 *
 * A phone draws one group, so a split made at the desk was unreachable from
 * it. This is the way through: two fingers dragged up bring the next group
 * in from below, dragged down bring the previous one from above, in tree
 * order and without wrapping. The cards ride the fingers 1:1 and settle on
 * a spring, so the deck reads as a physical stack rather than a transition.
 *
 * Two fingers, never one. One finger already belongs to the transcript's
 * scroll and to the tab swipe in `gesture.svelte.ts`, and both must go on
 * working exactly as they do. Only a touch count of exactly two is ever
 * looked at here; the one-finger machine keeps its own guard against a
 * second finger landing mid-drag.
 *
 * CSS owns rest, this file owns motion. The stylesheet parks every card by
 * its distance from the focus; nothing here is rendered by a template per
 * frame. While the fingers hold the stack the handlers write a translate
 * straight onto the three cards in view, and at release the settle — a
 * spring with no randomness in it — is integrated once and handed to the
 * compositor as keyframes, so it plays at the display's rate whatever the
 * main thread is doing. When it lands the inline transforms are cleared and
 * the stylesheet's parking places take over again.

/**
 * The effort scale the product offers, in the order the API names it: from the
 * level that thinks least to the one that thinks hardest. Unlike the permission
 * modes next door, the labels are the API's own words — a reader who moves
 * between this slider and Anthropic's docs should be reading one vocabulary,
 * and "extra high" would be our paraphrase of a name that already exists.
 *
 * The descriptions are Anthropic's guidance verbatim for the same reason. They
 * describe what a level is *for*, which is the only thing that tells someone
 * which one to pick; a shorter line of our own would be a guess dressed as
 * advice. Effort is not only thinking depth — a lower level also buys fewer and
 * more consolidated tool calls, less preamble and terser confirmations.

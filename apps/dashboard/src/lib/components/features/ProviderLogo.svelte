   * is wider than it is tall gets letterboxed inside that square and lands
   * shorter than the number asked for. The `logos` set is a brand set, not an
   * icon set, and several of its entries are wordmarks — `logos:nvidia` is
   * 512x98, so at 9px it draws 1.7px of ink and reads as a smudge, while
   * `logos:google-gemini` (512x188) and `logos:meta-icon` (256x171) land short
   * by different amounts again. That is why a single ring could never sit at an
   * even distance from all of them. Where `logos` has only a wide mark, the
   * square sibling from `thesvg-color` is used instead.

    Sized in CSS, not by `width`/`height` alone. Those are presentation
    attributes, which sit at the bottom of the cascade and lose to any rule that
    happens to match — and these marks arrive from `unplugin-icons` already
    carrying `width="1.2em" height="1.2em"`, which every other icon in the app
    overrides with a `size-*` class. A caller asking for 9px inside a 16px ring
    cannot afford to be the one place where that silently resolves to `1.2em`
    instead. The attributes stay for the intrinsic size before CSS applies.

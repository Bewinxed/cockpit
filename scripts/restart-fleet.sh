# Restart cockpit's services after a delay, then prove the fleet came back.
#
# Why the delay: the agent hosts the Claude Code sessions, so the session that
# asks for this restart is itself mid-turn, and `cockpit service restart
# --when-idle` would wait on a turn that cannot finish until the command it is
# running returns. Sleeping first lets the asking turn end before the agent is
# touched.
#
# Why this must be launched with `systemd-run --user` and not `nohup … &`:
# cockpit-agent.service is KillMode=control-group, and anything spawned from a
# session lives in that cgroup. Restarting the agent would kill this script
# halfway through. Run it in its own transient unit and it outlives the restart:
#
#   systemd-run --user --unit=cockpit-restart --collect \
#     scripts/restart-fleet.sh [delay-seconds]
#
# Reads back to journalctl --user -u cockpit-restart, and to the log file below.
